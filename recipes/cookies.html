    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies are claimed to have originated in the United States in 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter: This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li>
        <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</li>
        <li>Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. </li>
        <li>Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla. </li>
        <li>Dissolve baking soda in hot water. Add to batter along with salt. </li>
        <li>Stir in flour, chocolate chips, and walnuts. </li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are nicely browned, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. /li>
    </ol>
